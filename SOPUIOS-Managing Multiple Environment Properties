SOAPUI Pro allows to Manage Test Data for Multiple Enviornments

For eaxmple ,it is very common that same API (application) might deployed on multiple environments like:
    1. Dev Server 
    2. QA Server
    3. Staging Server
    4. Production -1 Server
    5. Production -2 Server
 
 By default SOAPUI OS will not help us to Manage Test Data for Multiple Enviornments.
 
 But it is possible to implement Similar to that for SOAPUI Opensource Version.
 
 All you need to know little groovy scripting
  
 Since it is same application API calls will be same but the data will be different.
 
 Hint:
 1. Define a 'env' Property @ Project elevel
            by just changing this property test suite can be switched to eny environment.
 2. Create a Test Case exclusively to hold propertys of each enviornment
 3. Create a property step for each environemnt
      Like: 
         Project
            TestSuite
              TestCase
                Property Step-DevServer
                Property Step-QAServer
                Property Step-StgServer
                    Now create property Names Like(In all above properties):
                                endPoint/Host      //Remember this will be different for each Environemnt
                                UserName
                                Password
              Groovy Step to Load Specific Properties to Project Level Properties:
 4. Make sure resmaining Test Cases are refferrning the Project level properties                 
 5. Refer example Test Suite @
