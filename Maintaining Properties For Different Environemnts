Maintaining Properties For Different Environemnts

Maintaining Properties For Different Environemnts
    Generally Same Applications are deployed into different environement:
      1.Test Server               or TEST Environemnt
      2.Staging Environment       or STAG Environment
      3.Production Environemnt-1: or PROD1
      4.Production Environemnt-2: or PROD2
 Since the application is same, One suite created for one environemnt must run in other environments too.
 But different environments may have different configuration/test data:
 for example:
        EndPoint Will different for each environment
        Application Login Credentails may be same or different based on configuration
        Other application specific input data.
For manging the Different environment Data We have superb feature in SOAPUI Pro/Ready API
But how can we handle this with OpenSource SOAPUI?

Here are the two Solutions:
1. Create External CSV File (Data Source) for each environment and Load then conditionally
2. Create one property file for each environment and based on required requirement enable only that property step and disable other properties steps.
