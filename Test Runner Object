testRunner - a TestCaseRunner object, 

which is the entry-point to the soapUI API for accessing project items, results, etc. 
The testRunner is the object that is actually executing the TestCase by cycling through the 
TestSteps in the TestCase and executing them. It exposes methods related to test execution and 
the underlying object model (via the testCase property). Common usage scenarios are:

using testRunner.testCase to get hold of the containing TestCase from which all other objects in the 
project can be accessed and manipulated using testRunner.fail(...) (or testRunner.cancel) to abort the 
ongoing TestCase when an error occurs using 
    testRunner.gotoStepByName(...) 
    or 
    testRunning.runTestStepByName( ... ) 
to transfer execution to another step than the one after the Script TestStep in the TestCase (see ...)
