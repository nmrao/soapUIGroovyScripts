Use log.info <variable> to get the class of a variable, such as the testRunner. 

Then you can refer to this class in the SoapUI API documentation.

Use the Groovy shortcut notation for getters and setters. 

For example, use 
	testRunner.testCase 
		instead of testRunner.getTestCase() 
and 
	project.abortOnError = true 
		instead of project.setAbortOnError(true)
