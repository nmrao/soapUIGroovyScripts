When we run Test Suite from Command line using testRunner.sh
some times JVM may complain some font type not available

Sample:
net.sf.jasperreports.engine.util.JRFontNotFoundException: Font 'Arial' is not available to the JVM. See the Javadoc for more details.

To solve this issue:
we need to copy the linux equivalent font to : JDK_HOME\\jre\\lib\\fonts
