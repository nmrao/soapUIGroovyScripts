Creating jar files and deploying it in ext folder of SOAP UI:

1.Create a new groovy script file with a class (follows java standards in file naming i.e. class name and file name should be same)
2.Compile the groovy code file
3.Create the jar file
4.Deploy the jar file at SoapUI_Home/bin/ext folder
5.Restart the SoapUI if was already open
6.Create the object of class and use the methods anywhere in the SoapUI projects

Note: If you are migrating your project to some other machine, make sure to migrate these libraries as well if you are using them in projects

***********Detailed Example********************:

Step 1: Create a new groovy script file with a class structure

	i. Considering the class ScriptLibrary that contain a method named printTestDetails as in following code in it:

	class ScriptLibrary  {

    		def context
    		def testRunner
    		def log

    		def printTestDetails(def PrintThisToo) {
        	log.info 'Name of the test case is :'+testRunner.testCase.name
        	log.info 'Name of the test suite is : '+testRunner.testCase.testSuite.name
        	log.info PrintThisToo
    		}
	}
	
	ii. Save the file with class name, ScriptLibrary.groovy in this case

Step 2: Compile the code

i. Open command prompt and fire following command (from the folder where where your .groovy file is kept)

	Compile the code:
		groovyc -d classes SimplePrint.groovy

Step 3: Create the jar file

	i. After compiling the code we can create the jar Create jar file:

		jar cvf SimplePrint.jar -C classes .

Step 4: Deploy the jar file at SoapUI_Home/bin/ext folder

Step 5: Restart the SoapUI if was already open

Step 6: Create the object of class and use the methods anywhere in the SoapUI projects

	i. Creating object

		def scripts = new ScriptLibrary(context:context, log:log, testRunner:testRunner)

	ii. Calling methods
		scripts.printTestDetails(“This is my argument”)
