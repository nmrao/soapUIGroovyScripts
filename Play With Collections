We commonly Use Following collections in Scripting:
  
  ArrayList : Maintains insertion order
  
  HashMap   : class offers constant time performance for the basic operations (add, remove, contains and size)
  
  Treemap   : Keys will be sorted
  
  Hashset   : No Duplicates
              Does not guarantee that the order of elements will remain constant over time
              
  TreeSet   : No Duplicates, Tree Set elements are sorted in ascending order by default
