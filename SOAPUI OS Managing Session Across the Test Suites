SOAPUIPro/Ready API allow to write events.
    Using events we can perform some special and general purpose actions on each request().
    Like, Pass session id generated by Login Step to each subsequent HTTP request (All Test Steps in any testsuite or test case )so that SOAPUI can 
    add automatically session id/cookie as a header.

But this feature is lacking in SOAPUI free version.

But SOAPUI(both free/Commercial Pro) allows to pass session ID/cookie to all subsequent requests with in test case by Just checking 'Maintain HTTP Session'  
option at test case level properties.

But the same cannot be done accross the testcases and accross the test suites.

So how to solve this problem in Open Source SOAPUI Open source.

Procedure:
  1. Extract session ID/Cookie from Login Response.
  2. Set that to a project level property
  3. Then add a header for each request with name sessionId/Cookie  and refer the property defined @ Project level, mentioned in step 2
  
Some people may feel it is very difficult to do this,but if you are going for free version it is ok,also in each test suite , the unique requests are less
