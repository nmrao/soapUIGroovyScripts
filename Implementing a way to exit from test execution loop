Implementing a way to exit from test execution loop

Different ways to exit the test execution:
    1.Creating  one second delay step in the end of test case and jumping to that step by using testRunner.gotoStepByName();
    2.Creating  one dummy groovy step in the end of test case and jumping to that step by using testRunner.gotoStepByName();
    3.Using testRunner.Cancel
