In order to extend SOAPUI functionality we might need to use external jars:

For example in SOAPUI Free Version,
     1. There is no builtin test Step to send Email .
     2. These is no builtin support to use Excel File as a Data Source
     3. Database drivers to connect required DB

SOAPUI Allows to use external jars to extend the functionality>
Those Jars we can keep in <SOAPUI_HOME>\bin\ext directory.

Here are the Path:
     OpenSource Verion Ext Version Path: C:\Program Files (x86)\SmartBear\SoapUI-5.3.0\bin\ext
     Commercial Version Path:            C:\Program Files\SmartBear\ReadyAPI-1.9.0\bin\ext
